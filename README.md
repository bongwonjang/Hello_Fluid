# Hello_Fluid

This is a simple cuda project on fluid simulation and CUDA+OpenGL interop.<br/>
Since the purpose of this project is implementing fluid simulation computation to CUDA+OpenGL interop,<br/>
I didn't fully understand the mathematical theory on Naiver Stokes Equation.<br/>

I refered 2 source codes as follows:<br/>
[1] [CUDA+OpenGL interop](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/26665bf33b2df3f03f52467d954090f8a19d0e71/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/simpleGL)<br/>
[2] [Navier Stokes Equation in CUDA](https://github.com/MomoDeve/FluidSimulation)<br/>

It was relly meaningful experience to restart programming CUDA and OpenGL together.<br/>
Since I am pursuing my ms degree on parallelizing deep learning, parallel programming always makes me touched.<br/>

End.
